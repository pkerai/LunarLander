#Lunar Lander project
# This program is a game which is about trying to land a space ship on the moom.
# The program aks the user how much of the fuel it should burn to decellerate
# the space ship. The idea of the program is to land on the moon without crashing.
# This is achieved if the landing velocity is less than 10 metres/second.
